Program Description:
This program creates a database for Florida city populations in 2023, simulates population growth for 20 years at a 2% annual growth rate, and provides a visual representation of the growth for any selected city
---
Logical Steps:
1. Create a SQLite database named population_GC.db and a table named population.
2. Populate the table with initial population data for 10 Florida cities for the year 2023.
3. Simulate population growth for each city for the next 20 years (2024â€“2043).
4. Allow the user to select a city from the list to visualize its population growth using a line graph.
5. Continue providing visualization options until the user exits the program.

Variables:
1. conn: Connection object for SQLite database.
2. cities: List of tuples containing the names, years, and population data for the cities.
3. years: List of years used for plotting population growth.
4. populations: List of population values corresponding to the years for a specific city.
